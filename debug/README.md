# Debug

Debug is a debugging library for microservices

## Overview

Debug is a pluggable library for debugging. It includes base level requirements for logging, tracing and metrics. 
Our goal is to provide a simple experience for understanding what's happening in a running system with zero dependencies 
by default or by plugging into robust systems like ELK, zipkin, etc.

## Features

- Health (Checks)
